# 📉 Churn Analysis Prediction – Data Science Project

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. It involves analyzing customer data to identify patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave a service or continue. The goal is to help businesses improve customer retention through data-driven insights.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn is a key metric in subscription-based businesses. In this project, we:

- Explored and cleaned a churn dataset
- Identified key churn drivers
- Built classification models to predict churn
- Visualized patterns and insights
- Evaluated model performance using standard metrics

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models
- **LabelEncoder**, **Train-Test Split**, **Confusion Matrix**

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary stats, missing values, churn distribution
- **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding categorical variables, handling missing values
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features, correlation analysis
- **Model Training**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix
- **Insights**: Which features (like tenure, monthly charges) impact churn
